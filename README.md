# Final Capstone Activity: Penetration Testing & CTF
**Author:** Marlo Clarke  
**Course:** Parocyber Bootcamp | Cisco Ethical Hacking Certification

## Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive penetration testing exercise conducted in a Capture the Flag (CTF) format. The engagement simulated a real-world scenario where I was hired to conduct reconnaissance, launch exploits against discovered vulnerabilities, and provide remediation strategies to secure the environment.

## Objectives
- Conduct full-cycle penetration tests on target networks (10.5.5.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/24).
- Utilize ethical hacking skills to locate hidden flag values.
- Document successful exploits and propose industry-standard remediation steps.

## Core Challenges
1. **SQL Injection:** Exploiting a web application to harvest database credentials.
2. **Web Server Misconfiguration:** Leveraging directory listing vulnerabilities to find sensitive data.
3. **SMB Service Exploitation:** Enumerating and accessing unsecured network shares.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyzing PCAP files to identify target locations and credentials.

## Required Resources
- Kali Linux VM (customized for Ethical Hacker course)
- Target environment hosts on 10.5.5.x and 192.168.0.x subnets

## Conclusion
This capstone activity successfully identified critical vulnerabilities ranging from injection flaws to misconfigured network services. The findings underscore the importance of defense-in-depth, including secure coding practices, hardened server configurations, and robust access controls.
