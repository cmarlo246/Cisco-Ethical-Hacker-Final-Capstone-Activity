# Final Capstone Activity: Penetration Testing & CTF
**Author:** Marlo Clarke  
**Course:** Parocyber Bootcamp | Cisco Ethical Hacking Certification

## Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive penetration testing exercise conducted in a Capture the Flag (CTF) format. The engagement simulated a real-world scenario where I was hired to conduct reconnaissance, launch exploits against discovered vulnerabilities, and provide remediation strategies to secure the environment.

## Objectives
- [cite_start]Conduct full-cycle penetration tests on target networks (10.5.5.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/24)[cite: 1, 15].
- [cite_start]Utilize ethical hacking skills to locate hidden flag values[cite: 3].
- [cite_start]Document successful exploits and propose industry-standard remediation steps[cite: 14].

## Core Challenges
1. [cite_start]**SQL Injection:** Exploiting a web application to harvest database credentials[cite: 9].
2. [cite_start]**Web Server Misconfiguration:** Leveraging directory listing vulnerabilities to find sensitive data[cite: 10].
3. [cite_start]**SMB Service Exploitation:** Enumerating and accessing unsecured network shares[cite: 11].
4. [cite_start]**Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyzing PCAP files to identify target locations and credentials[cite: 12].

## Required Resources
- [cite_start]Kali Linux VM (customized for Ethical Hacker course)[cite: 13].
- [cite_start]Target environment hosts on 10.5.5.x and 192.168.0.x subnets[cite: 15].

## Conclusion
This capstone activity successfully identified critical vulnerabilities ranging from injection flaws to misconfigured network services. The findings underscore the importance of defense-in-depth, including secure coding practices, hardened server configurations, and robust access controls.
